# GIT DOWN with Erin
## Introduction to Git

This is a simple readme file in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

Markdown is **great** and you *should use it!* Because it is a plain text file, git handles it very well.

Include code, either inline (e.g., `for key in dict`) or in blocks:

``` python
for key in dict:
    print(key)
```

Also, LaTeX is handled similarly, (e.g. $e=mc^2$).

Added some comments to the file during presentation.
